# 🌱 Carbon Footprint Calculator

A fullstack application to estimate personal carbon footprints based on housing, travel, food, products, and services consumption.  
Built with **Next.js 15 + shadcn/ui** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express** on the backend.

## 🚀 Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/luccasmtxr/carbon-app.git
cd carbon-app
```

## 📂 Project Structure

Both the frontend and backend include dedicated README files with more detailed usage instructions and examples.

```
carbon-app/
├── backend/      # Node.js + Express API

Each folder (`backend/` and `frontend/`) contains its own **README** with setup details.

## 🖥 Running Locally

### Backend

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev   # runs on http://localhost:7007
```

### Frontend
In another terminal:
```bash
